Shock Build Notes----------------First build the libraries- go into the Libraries folder, and in each sub folder open the project in Metrowerks.  Build the library, then copy the library file you just made into the LIB folder inside the Shock Folder.Second, build the game- open the Shock project and build it.You may also have to recompile the precompiled headers in the LIB folder.
